The coefficients are chosen such that the interpolating function passes through all the data points, while the transitions between polynomials are as smooth as possible given their degree. For example, each grid cell in a linear interpolation (such as `yitp`) is associated with a straight line, and the interpolation is continuous (with discontinuous derivative) over the entire domain.\n",

The first term (`Line`) specifies the behavior of the boundary condition, the second (`OnCell`) specifies where it applies. In this case `yitp_quadratic` will become linear for `x < 0.5` or `x > 10.5`. The alternative, `OnGrid`, would apply the boundary condition for `x < 1` or `x > 10`.\n",
