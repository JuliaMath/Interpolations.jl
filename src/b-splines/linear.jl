"""
Assuming uniform knots with spacing 1, the `i`th peice of linear b-spline
implemented here is defined as follows.

    y_i(x) = c p(x) + cp p(1-x)

where

    p(δx) = x

and the values `cX` for `X ∈ {_, p}` are the coefficients.

Linear b-splines are naturally interpolating, and require no prefiltering;
there is therefore no need for boundary conditions to be provided.

Also, although the implementation is slightly different in order to re-use
the framework built for general b-splines, the resulting interpolant is just
a piecewise linear function connecting each pair of neighboring data points.
